# SQL-Recipe-Database
Database Design Project: Python application where a user is able to view and upload different cooking recipes

- Install some version of Python 3. We used Python 3.7.9 and the Python IDLE to run our code
- Use pip in your terminal to install PyQt5, PyQt Tools, as well as pymysql
- “pip install PyQt5” should be enough to install PyQt5
- Documentation: https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/
- “pip install pyqt5-tools” installs the Qt Tools necessary to run - Documentation: https://pypi.org/project/pyqt5-tools/
- “python3 -m pip install PyMySQL” for pymysql
- Documentation: https://pypi.org/project/PyMySQL/
- Simply open the file `finalPtest.py` in the Python IDLE and run the module, the program will then request the password needed to access your local SQL Workbench.
